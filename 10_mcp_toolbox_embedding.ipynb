        "> **Content:** *\"Service was terrible. The front desk was rude and the check-in took forever.\"*\n",
        "> **Distance:** `0.27` (Lowest / Best)\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Why it won:** Even though your search query (\"bad experience with staff\") did **not** contain the words \"front desk\", \"rude\", or \"check-in\", the embedding model (Gemini) understands that:\n",

        "> **Distance:** `0.34` (Medium)\n",

        "*   **Why it's second:** This is also a **negative review** (\"bad experience\").\n",
        "*   **Why it's not first:** It talks about *facilities* (bed, AC), not *people* (staff).\n",
        "*   **Conclusion:** The model sees that the *sentiment* (unhappy) matches your query, but the *topic* (room vs. staff) is different, so the distance is slightly higher.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Why it's here:** Your SQL query asked for `LIMIT 3`. Since you likely only ingested 5 items total, the database *had* to return a 3rd result.\n",
        "*   **Why it's last:** This is a **positive** review about facilities. It is semantically very far away from \"bad experience with staff,\" so it has the highest distance score.\n",

        "You have successfully built a system that searches by **meaning**, not just keywords. If this were a standard keyword search, Result #1 might have failed because it didn't contain the exact word \"staff\"."
